    //each opeartion wiats for the last one to complete 
//blocking code and non blocking code 
        // blocking code
            //block the execution of code
            //read file sync
        // non blocking code
            //does not block execution of code 
            //read file async

//web api 
    //DOM
    //set time out
    //set interval

//task queue
    //add task to call stack

//example
    //print 1
    //timeinterval(0) print 2
    //print 3

    //op
    1 
    3
    2
    //because timeinterval is added to call stack

//fetch api have high priority comes from priority queue
